   - Created locales directory for translation files (sv.json, en.json)

2. **Middleware**
   - Implemented language detection based on browser settings
   - Set up redirections to appropriate language routes
   - Configured to preserve URL structure across language versions

3. **Translation System**

   - Implemented dictionary utility for fetching translations
   - Updated components to use translations

4. **Language Switcher**
   - Added UI component to navigation bar
   - Implemented language switching while preserving current page

5. **SEO Enhancements**

6. **Component Updates**
   - Updated all service components with dual-language support
   - Updated project cards and project modal with translations
   - Implemented dynamic testimonial translations
   - Added translation for contact form labels and buttons

### Technical Approach
- Used Next.js App Router's built-in support for dynamic routes
- Leveraged server components for translation loading

- Enhanced user experience for non-Swedish speakers
- Demonstrated internationalization implementation skills

## Overall Status
The project has been deployed and is now fully multilingual, supporting both Swedish (default) and English. The Memory Bank documentation system has been established to maintain context between development sessions. Recent work includes enhancing the logo presentation in the navbar and footer, with adjustments to sizes and layout structure to improve visual hierarchy and brand presence. The website domain has been updated from eken-consulting.netlify.app to the custom domain eken-consulting.com, with all necessary updates to sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and metadata references.
