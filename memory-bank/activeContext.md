# Active Context

## Internationalization (i18n) Implementation

The portfolio website has now been fully updated with multilingual support for both Swedish and English. This implementation follows a comprehensive approach:

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── [lang]/      # Dynamic route for language handling
│   │   ├── page.tsx # Root page
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx   # Root layout (language-independent)
├── locales/         # Directory for language files
│   ├── sv.json      # Swedish translations
│   └── en.json      # English translations
├── lib/
│   ├── dictionary.ts # Translation utility
│   ├── projects-data.ts # Projects with translations
│   └── testimonials-data.ts # Testimonials with translations
└── middleware.ts    # For language detection and redirection
```

### Language Detection Strategy
1. **URL-based language identification** - Using `/sv/` and `/en/` path prefixes
2. **Automatic language detection** - Checking the user's browser language settings
3. **Default to Swedish** - When no language is specified or detected

### Key Components
1. **Middleware** - Detects browser language preference and redirects accordingly
2. **Translation Files** - JSON files containing all text content in each language
3. **Language Switcher** - UI toggle in the navigation bar
4. **Helper Functions** - Utilities to get translated projects and testimonials
5. **Dynamic Metadata** - Language-specific page titles and descriptions

### SEO Implementation
1. **hreflang Tags** - For indicating language alternatives to search engines
2. **Language-specific Metadata** - Titles and descriptions in each language
3. **Sitemap Updates** - Including all language versions of each page
4. **Canonical URLs** - Ensuring proper canonical URL structure

## Current Focus
The website is now fully implemented with both language versions working properly. All major components have been updated to support both languages, and the website has been enhanced with custom logo graphics:

- Navigation bar with language switcher
- Hero section
- IdeaToReality section
- Service cards
- Project cards and modals
- Testimonials section
- Contact form with translated labels

## UI Component Enhancements

### IdeaToReality Process Flow
The IdeaToReality component has been enhanced with a visual flow representation:

1. **Desktop Implementation**:
   - Changed layout to display all steps horizontally in a row
   - Added animated, pulsating arrows between steps to visually connect the process flow
   - Maintained original card design with icons and descriptions

2. **Mobile Implementation**:
   - Kept vertical layout for smaller screens
   - Added pulsating downward arrows between steps
   - Ensured smooth responsive transitions between layouts

### Testimonials Section Improvements

1. **Content Visibility**:
   - Doubled testimonial display time from 8 to 16 seconds to give users more time to read
   - Improved readability on mobile devices with optimized text size

2. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Increased text size from text-sm to text-base on mobile
   - Increased padding inside cards from 4px to 5px
   - Added more vertical space to blockquote sections

3. **Layout Considerations**:
   - Maintained narrow, focused width (max-w-3xl) on desktop
   - Allowed full width on mobile for better readability
   - Optimized spacing between elements for improved mobile experience

## Recent Changes
- Added custom logos to the project, integrating them into the UI:
  - Created logos directory in public folder to properly organize logo assets
  - Added logo-icon and logo-text to the navbar for consistent branding
  - Updated favicon to use the new logo icon for improved brand recognition in browser tabs
  - Added full logo to footer for visual consistency
- Created fundamental directory structure for i18n with [lang] dynamic route
- Implemented middleware for automatic language detection and redirection
- Created translation files (sv.json and en.json) for all site content
- Updated all UI components to pull text from translation files
- Modified project and testimonial data structures to include translations
- Created helper functions (getProjectData, getTestimonialData) for translations
- Added language switcher component to the navigation bar
- Updated metadata to include language alternates
- Created sitemap.xml with hreflang references
- Ensured all form labels and placeholders are properly translated
- Fixed missing translations in service cards and project components

## Next Steps
1. **Analytics Integration**: Consider adding web analytics for tracking visitors
2. **Additional Content**: Continue enhancing project content now that the multilingual framework is in place
3. **Fine-tuning**: Ensure consistent design and behavior across both language versions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Check and optimize page loading times
5. **Further Testing**: Test the site across more devices and browsers

## Active Decisions
- Maintaining Swedish as the default language
- Using dynamically generated content for all text to support translations
- Separating content from presentation to facilitate language switching

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Translation Organization**: All text content stored in JSON files by language
- **Component Adaptations**: Components receive translated content via props
- **URL Structure**: Consistent URL patterns across language versions
- **SEO Focus**: Proper metadata and markup for multilingual content

## Recent Learnings
- Next.js App Router provides excellent built-in support for internationalization
- JSON translation files offer a maintainable structure for managing content
- Client-side language detection can be efficiently implemented through middleware
- Separating translations into locales directory keeps the codebase organized

## Open Questions
- Should additional languages be added in the future?
- How to best implement analytics that respect language preferences?
- Should project filtering also be language-specific?

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent translations across all site content
- Maintaining synchronized updates when adding new content
- Optimizing performance with the added language switching capability
- Fixed navbar scroll animation lag on iOS devices by implementing throttling and hardware acceleration

## Priority Areas
1. Content enhancement now that i18n is in place
2. Testing language switching on all pages
3. SEO verification for multilingual implementation
4. Performance optimization
