## Internationalization (i18n) Implementation

The portfolio website has now been fully updated with multilingual support for both Swedish and English. This implementation follows a comprehensive approach:

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── [lang]/      # Dynamic route for language handling
│   │   ├── page.tsx # Root page
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx   # Root layout (language-independent)
├── locales/         # Directory for language files
│   ├── sv.json      # Swedish translations
│   └── en.json      # English translations
├── lib/
│   ├── dictionary.ts # Translation utility
│   ├── projects-data.ts # Projects with translations
│   └── testimonials-data.ts # Testimonials with translations
└── middleware.ts    # For language detection and redirection
```

### Language Detection Strategy
1. **URL-based language identification** - Using `/sv/` and `/en/` path prefixes
2. **Automatic language detection** - Checking the user's browser language settings
3. **Default to Swedish** - When no language is specified or detected

### Key Components
1. **Middleware** - Detects browser language preference and redirects accordingly
2. **Translation Files** - JSON files containing all text content in each language
3. **Language Switcher** - UI toggle in the navigation bar
4. **Helper Functions** - Utilities to get translated projects and testimonials
5. **Dynamic Metadata** - Language-specific page titles and descriptions

### SEO Implementation
1. **hreflang Tags** - For indicating language alternatives to search engines
2. **Language-specific Metadata** - Titles and descriptions in each language
3. **Sitemap Updates** - Including all language versions of each page
4. **Canonical URLs** - Ensuring proper canonical URL structure

## Current Focus
The website is now fully implemented with both language versions working properly. All major components have been updated to support both languages:

- Navigation bar with language switcher
- Hero section
- IdeaToReality section
- Service cards
- Project cards and modals
- Testimonials section
- Contact form with translated labels

## Recent Changes
- Created fundamental directory structure for i18n with [lang] dynamic route
- Implemented middleware for automatic language detection and redirection
- Created translation files (sv.json and en.json) for all site content
- Updated all UI components to pull text from translation files
- Modified project and testimonial data structures to include translations
- Created helper functions (getProjectData, getTestimonialData) for translations
- Added language switcher component to the navigation bar
- Updated metadata to include language alternates
- Created sitemap.xml with hreflang references
- Ensured all form labels and placeholders are properly translated
- Fixed missing translations in service cards and project components

## Next Steps
1. **Analytics Integration**: Consider adding web analytics for tracking visitors
2. **Additional Content**: Continue enhancing project content now that the multilingual framework is in place
3. **Fine-tuning**: Ensure consistent design and behavior across both language versions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Check and optimize page loading times
5. **Further Testing**: Test the site across more devices and browsers

## Active Decisions
- Maintaining Swedish as the default language
- Using dynamically generated content for all text to support translations
- Separating content from presentation to facilitate language switching

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Translation Organization**: All text content stored in JSON files by language
- **Component Adaptations**: Components receive translated content via props
- **URL Structure**: Consistent URL patterns across language versions
- **SEO Focus**: Proper metadata and markup for multilingual content

## Recent Learnings
- Next.js App Router provides excellent built-in support for internationalization
- JSON translation files offer a maintainable structure for managing content
- Client-side language detection can be efficiently implemented through middleware
- Separating translations into locales directory keeps the codebase organized

## Open Questions
- Should additional languages be added in the future?
- How to best implement analytics that respect language preferences?
- Should project filtering also be language-specific?

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent translations across all site content
- Maintaining synchronized updates when adding new content
- Optimizing performance with the added language switching capability

## Priority Areas
1. Content enhancement now that i18n is in place
2. Testing language switching on all pages
3. SEO verification for multilingual implementation
4. Performance optimization
